# Delivery App

A Flutter application designed to handle delivery orders with real-time synchronized tracking between the delivery driver and the customer.

## Overview

This app allows delivery drivers to receive incoming orders, accept them, and then follow a delivery sequence that leads to the customer. The progress of the delivery is synchronized in real-time with the customer's app, allowing both parties to track the order status simultaneously.

## Features

- Receive and manage delivery orders.
- Accept or reject incoming orders.
- Real-time order status updates.
- Synchronized delivery tracking for both the delivery driver and the customer.
- Seamless transition from order acceptance to delivery completion.
