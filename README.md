# Delivery App

A Flutter application designed to handle delivery orders with real-time synchronized tracking between the delivery driver and the customer.

## Overview

This app allows delivery drivers to receive incoming orders, accept them, and then follow a delivery sequence that leads to the customer. The progress of the delivery is synchronized in real-time with the customer's app, allowing both parties to track the order status simultaneously.
